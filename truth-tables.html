  <h2>Determining truth-values</h2>
  <p>The basic question is: how is the truth-value of a complex proposition a function of the truth-values of its corresponding parts? More specifically, we can ask: Consider $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$. Suppose you knew that $r$ is false while $p,q$ are true. Is $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ true or false?</p>
  <p>We develop a general method for answering these questions. This is useful since often the sentences whose truth weâ€™re interested in are complex, and so the method gives us a way to determine truth/falsity based on prior knowledge of truth/ falsity of smaller components.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>Building more complex tables</h2>
  <p>We describe a general method for building a truth-table for each proposition, even the complex ones like $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$.</p>
  <p>By following this method, we will have a big table that tells us what the truth-value of $p\rightarrow (q\vee r)$ is, given the truth-value of its components.</p>
  <p>We build the big table by slowly decomposing the complex formula into its simpler components and successively applying the five truth tables for the propositional connectives which we have memorized.</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>In this example, there are two basic propositional letters $p$ and $q$, and so there are four rows. We fill out the columns corresponding to each connective, starting with the connectives that come first in the order in which the proposition is built up out the propositional letters. </p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="~(p\/q)"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"
           data-carnap-system="gamutPND">
  </pre>
  <p> Try it out yourself, and for the solution see the next slide. <p>

  <p>Note that in the videos, there is added highlighting. But this was added in a video editor afterwards. There is no highlighting in the program itself.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>In this example, we start with the conjunction $\wedge$ and move onto the negation $\neg$. This is because the order in which the proposition became a proposition was: first we took the basic propositional letters $p$ and $q$ and made the conjunction $p\wedge q$. Then we negated this to make $\neg (p \wedge q)$.</p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="~(p/\q)"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"

  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>In the first two examples, at the last step we handled the negation. In this, we are applying the basic truth-table for negation which we learned earlier:
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="~p"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms immutable nocheck"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"
           data-carnap-system="gamutPND">
  FT
  TF
  </pre>
  <p>We can apply this truth-table by thinking about its two rows as two rules for negation: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>If $p$ is true, then $\neg p$ is false.</li>
  <li>If $p$ is false, then $\neg p$ is true.</li>
  </ul>

  </section>

  <section>
  <h2>Example 3</h2>
  <p>In the first two examples, we had two propositional connectives. In this example, we have three connectives: two instances of negation and one instance of conjunction. The way in which the proposition $\neg p \wedge \neg q$ became a proposition was by first taking $p$, putting a negation on it to get $\neg p$, and then taking $q$ and putting a negation on it to get $\neg q$, and finally conjoining them together to get a conjunction $\neg p \wedge \neg q$.</p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="(~p/\~q)"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"
           data-carnap-system="gamutPND">

  <h2>Example 4</h2>
  <p>Here is another example with three connectives, except this time the last connective is a disjunction.</p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="(~p\/~q)"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"

  <section>
  <h2>Example 5</h2>
  <p>The way that the proposition $p\rightarrow \neg q$ became a proposition was by first putting a negation on the propositional letter to get $\neg q$, and then by forming an implication with antecedent $p$ and consequent $\neg q$. Hence, first we apply the rule for negation, and then we apply the rule for implication. To apply the rule for implication, we have to correctly identify the antecedent column ($p$) and the consequent column ($\neg q$).</p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="(p->~q)"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"
           data-carnap-system="gamutPND">

  <h2>Example 6</h2>
  <p>In this example, we have three connectives: reading from left-to-right, we see one conjunction and two disjunctions. But the order in which the proposition became a proposition was: we took the two letters $p,q$ and we formed both their conjunction $p\wedge q$ and their disjunction $p\vee q$, and then we took the disjunction of these to form $(p\wedge q)\vee (p\vee q)$. </p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="((p/\q)\/(p\/q))"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
           data-carnap-tabletype="simple"

  <h2>Example 7</h2>
  <p>This last example has three letters $p,q,r$. Since there are three lettters and each can take two truth-values (true, false), there are $3\times 2 = 8$ rows.</p>
  <pre data-carnap-type="truthtable"
           data-carnap-goal="(p->(q\/r))"
           data-carnap-submission="none"
           data-carnap-options="nocounterexample autoAtoms"
